# Develop your own agent with Copilot Studio

This lab teaches you how to create and enhance a custom AI-powered customer service agent using Microsoft Copilot Studio. You'll start by learning to create a new agent, add content, and explore the fundamentals of **Message** and **Question** nodes, entities, slot filling, and variables, essential for building interactive conversational agents.

As you progress, you'll integrate external data sources and services with your agent. You'll use Power Automate to request data from other sources and return it in a conversational dialog. You'll also understand the basics of the **HTTP Request** node and how to retrieve information from external services. By pointing your agent to your website and other knowledge sources, you'll make it smarter and more capable of providing accurate information, guided by custom prompt instructions.

Finally, you'll explore advanced features like using plugin actions to interact with other data sources and invoking AI Builder prompts to analyze customer feedback. These skills will enable you to create a highly functional customer service agent that handles complex tasks and provides valuable insights. By the end of this lab, you'll understand how to leverage Microsoft Copilot Studio to improve customer service efficiency and support an organization's growing needs.

Founded in 2005 with headquarters in Seattle, WA, the company has grown significantly over the years. They now support over 900 hospitals and more than 15,000 individuals, providing essential medical equipment.

Despite their success, Contoso has faced challenges in recent years due to a surge in demand for their services.
